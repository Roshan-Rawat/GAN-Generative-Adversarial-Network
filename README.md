Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)         Python, Neural Networks

– Engineered a GAN model achieving 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, enhancing prediction accuracy through
adversarial training.

– Optimized training efficiency by 20% via hyperparameter fine-tuning, reducing model training time.

– Documented the design process, facilitating knowledge transfer and presentation to 30 peers, receiving positive feedback.
